## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have any issues with old versions, remember that they are not supported anymore, so first, be sure you have the newest BinCat version.

If you have an Issue with the last version of BinCat, please leave me an Issue in [Issue Page](https://github.com/Hipotesi-Dev/BinCat/issues). I will check it as soon as I can. It can be that your issue is not the first one to be solved, that's because I give priority to that one's that needed.
