## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter any issues with older versions, please note that they are no longer supported. Make sure you have the latest version of BinCat installed.

If you have an issue with the latest version of BinCat, please submit an issue on the [Issue Page](https://github.com/titodelas/BinCat/issues). I will review it as soon as possible. Please note that your issue may not be the first one to be addressed, as priority is given to those that require immediate attention.
